Feature Explanation: What Kairos Can and Can’t Do

What Kairos Can Do
* Analyze long‑form videos scene by scene
* Automatically splits videos into meaningful scenes and processes each one.
* Generate visual understanding
* Captions key frames to describe what’s happening visually.
* Detects objects to capture fine‑grained details.
* Analyze audio content
* Describes non‑speech sounds (e.g., ambience, effects).
* Transcribes spoken dialogue in each scene.
* Fuse multimodal evidence into rich scene descriptions
* Combines visual captions, object detections, sound descriptions, and speech into a single, coherent scene report.
* Produce narrative summaries and a final synopsis
* Builds higher‑level summaries from scene reports and then a final synopsis for the whole video.
* Enable retrieval‑style querying (RAG)
* Builds embeddings so you can ask questions and retrieve the most relevant scenes.
* Persist outputs for reuse
* Saves scene data, summaries, and logs so you can resume or reuse results without reprocessing.

What Kairos Can’t Do (Current Limitations)
* It doesn’t “understand” beyond its models
* It’s limited by the captioning, detection, ASR, and LLM accuracy; errors or hallucinations can appear.
* It doesn’t guarantee perfect scene boundaries
* Scene detection can miss subtle cuts or over‑segment fast‑moving content.
* It doesn’t provide real‑time processing
* Designed for offline processing of stored videos, not live streams.
* It doesn’t fully resolve complex narrative reasoning
* It summarizes, but it doesn’t deeply reason about plot structure, hidden motives, or nuanced themes.
* It doesn’t output polished film‑grade annotations
* Outputs are structured and useful, but not production‑ready cinematic annotations.
* It doesn’t automatically handle all video types equally
* Very static, very noisy, or visually abstract content may yield weaker results.
* It doesn’t answer questions without prior processing
* RAG requires that a video has already been processed and embedded.
